Add follow me social buttons. Uses font icons, ready for Retina Display.

No settings page, only a simple widget to add to your widget areas. 
It displays the Follow Me social buttons. No images, this widget uses a font icons so it makes it ready for Retina Display.

**Note**: The number of icons has grown considerably since the first version of the plugin, because of this, the widget UI needs to be rethought in order to make a good experience for the end user. 
I'll soon be working on a new version of the plugin, until then I will no longer add new icon requests.
